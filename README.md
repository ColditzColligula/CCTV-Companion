## Development Branch

#### Most-Up-To-Date but unstable and buggy.




### Planned Features:

- UI Rework: Make it so that the User picks a device and then accesses the features when a window for that device has been opened.
- More API Calls: Ability to see many different settings and also changing them (Network, User, Logs, Encoding, etc.)



The **red** buttons in the below screenshot are placeholders and have no function assigned to them at this point.
